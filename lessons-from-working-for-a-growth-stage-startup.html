        <div class="entry-content">
        <p>After spending close to 4 years and 3 months at Monetate, I decided it was time for me to move on.  I joined Monetate, a marketing tech company that builds data-driven products for online retailers and brands as employee number 36 and as an early member of the engineering team.  Monetate was an incredible place to work and everything I know about engineering, product management and the marketing tech industry, I owe it to the job. I wanted to capture my thoughts and more importantly reflect on the things I learned by being a part of a growth stage startup. During my time the headcount, clients, revenue and every other metric grew at a healthy rate and there were a number of ups and downs. Every stage brought along a number of interesting challenges.  Here is what I learned</p>
<h3>Be Thankful</h3>
<p>When I graduated, I knew I wanted to work for a startup. I was a few days away from moving to the bay area where I was interviewing with a few companies. Things took a turn and I ended up in suburban Philadelphia to work for a startup that was working on some innovative things in a space that I was interested in.  By the end of the first month, I knew I was going to stay with that startup for a while. I loved the product, the people and I was in fact surprised by all the things I was capable of doing. People say everyone will remember their first job and their first manager. I sure will. I was a blank slate and my manager taught me so many things and truly cared about my career path. More than a manager, he was a great mentor. </p>
<p>During the next four years, I had the opportunity to work with several amazing individuals from different departments. I learned a lot from every one of them. I am incredibly thankful.</p>
<h3>Every single employee can make a difference</h3>
<p>One of the great things about growth stage startups is, every single employee will have the opportunity to make a difference. I was able to see it first hand in several instances where initiatives taken by individuals or small teams had a significant impact on the business. When I say every single employee, I mean it.  Irrespective of the person’s role in the company, the fast-paced collaborative nature of a growth stage startup provides unlimited opportunities for those who are willing to go the extra mile. </p>
<h3>Having a good manager has a huge impact</h3>
<p>When a startup has less than 50 employees, having a flat structure under a strong leadership team with little hierarchy can do wonders. I truly believe in that system and Monetate adopted that methodology till it was feasible and it worked really well. Once a startup grows and transitions into a traditional management structure, it brings along a million complications. I was lucky that both the managers I had at Monetate were incredibly awesome. My second manager hired me as a product manager and helped me figure out a path for me based on where I want to go. He supported my ambitious and crazy initiatives, gave me interesting problems to solve, tolerated my failures and helped me become a better product manager. In many scenarios, he believed in me more than I believed in myself and that brought the best out of me. </p>
<p>A personal rule I have is my manager should be significantly better at what I am trying to get better at. This also applies indirectly to teammates. Unlike engineering teams, product management teams are significantly smaller and in turn are very tightly knit.  PMs in most teams come from different backgrounds and it is great opportunity to learn from each other. </p>
<h3>Product management is fun and impactful</h3>
<p>After a few years as an engineer, I switched over to product management. I had to do a lot of thinking but a couple of years in; I think it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It’s a great time to be an engineer now with all the amazing technology advancements and tools, but I am glad I was able to identify that I belonged in the product management group. </p>
<p>Having an engineering background is a great thing for product managers working on complex tech products. There are some cons, but those are very easy to overcome. </p>
<p>As a product manager, I learned how to make decisions and what it takes to build successful products. Success doesn't come just by building a perfectly good product. It involves an orchestrated effort from every other department (sales, marketing, service etc). I am stating the obvious here but working on all the different parts with different team members with products in different stages and more importantly failing a good number of times taught me so many things. </p>
<h3>Enterprise software is sexy</h3>
<p>Building good enterprise software is challenging. After decades of bad reputation set by the likes of IBM and Oracle where they had really awful software that everyone hated, things have a changed a lot for good. The expectations of buyers at enterprises have changed a lot in the recent years and thanks mainly to many of the disrupting startups that have changed the rules of the game. </p>
<p>Of course, it is hard to explain what you do to your grandparents or even your parents but being a part of a product that has the opportunity to have a meaning impact on several businesses is a great thing. </p>
<h3>Selling is an art</h3>
<p>During my initial days as an engineer, I had a big blind screen in front of me and I was one of those engineers who don't generally appreciate the world of sales and marketing. Even thought it was a small company, I had very little visibility on the things that happened outside my department. I wanted to change that and once in every 2-3 weeks, I started sitting in random sales calls and customer meetings. I would just sit and listen and the insights I got proved to be very helpful in many aspects of the job I was doing then.  Monetate had a great head of sales at that time and it was inspiring to see the way in which he built, trained and coached his team. I started appreciating the art of selling, the power of a good sales team and all the little big details. </p>
<h3>The importance of good communication is undervalued</h3>
<p>Communication is hard. When a startup has less than 50 people, internal communication isn’t something that needs a lot of attention. Everyone except the sales team will probably be in the same physical location and everyone knows each other by first name. I wonder if there is a startup Dunbar number. With yammer, slack, email and a weekly all-hands meeting, it isn’t hard to keep the team informed of what’s happening. </p>
<p>There is a point on the growth curve where things start breaking and internal silos get formed. New departments and new offices will start popping up and things will happen so fast, proper communication is the glue that holds everyone together. It isn’t a single person’s job and every department starting with engineering and product has a very important part to play. </p>
<h3>Being an immigrant startup employee is complicated</h3>
<p>While this isn’t something that applies to a majority of the people who work at startups, it had a profound impact for me. In a nation where first and second-generation immigrants have founded a significant percentage of companies especially in the tech sector, it is a sad reality that it is very complicated and hard for immigrants to work at startups. Out of the few hundred people Monetate hired over several years, I was the only employee who required a visa and this made things a little complicated at times. My managers and the leadership were very supportive in every single way possible and that helped a lot.  </p>
<p>It does cost a non-trivial amount in legal and government fees and it isn’t a one-time expenditure. Between applications, verifications, renewals, transfers, perm filings it adds up. Besides the cost, it takes a lot of time and attention. During my first application, we had to prove that Monetate was a real company and the job was real! Obviously the government has all the safeguards for fraud prevention. Random things like a small layoff will have an impact on the permanent residence application.  The employee is the only person who has to stay on top of every single detail and it is very taxing.</p>
<h3>Understand your stock options</h3>
<p>In the bay area, every social gathering with people working in technology sector will have a story about how they or someone who they know made a lot of money from stock options or missed the biggest opportunity of their life. In Philadelphia, those stories don’t exist yet. The majority of the folks I worked with had very little knowledge on how options worked. With exits becoming rare and considering the time factor, my general rule of thumb is to consider stock option grants as a nice piece of paper which has little to no value. If there is an upside, it is well and good. If there isn’t one, you just move on. I think it is very important for all startup employees who hold options to understand all the implications so that they can make informed decisions. </p>
<h3>Be Kind.</h3>
<p>As a product manager at a growth stage startup, the ultimate goal is to ensure the success of the product and that would involve interacting with almost every department in the company. In this process, it is very easy to spread thin and lose focus. One hard thing every PM will have to do is learning to say ‘no’ to a good number of things and focusing on the right things. Even if there was no intention, it is very easy to offend someone or at worst sound mean. The line between being confident and being arrogant is very thin. While this applies everywhere and not just in a startup setting, the most important thing is to be kind. </p>
<p>Monetate was a mature startup and cared about the work-life balance of its employees. It wasn’t one of those places where people spent crazy long hours in the office. However, it is sugar coated, a growth stage startup is a high-pressure work environment for many. It is much easier to be kind when I try to see things from the other person’s perspective. </p>
<p>I have been thinking about for a while and a few months back, I read a post by Andrew Bosworth and I really liked this part</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Being kind isn’t the same as being nice. It isn’t about superficial praise. It doesn’t mean dulling your opinions. And it shouldn’t diminish the passion with which you present them.</em></p>
<p><em>Being kind is fundamentally about taking responsibility for your impact on the people around you. It requires you be mindful of their feelings and considerate of the way your presence affects them.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is undoubtedly the biggest lesson I learned.</p>
